Javascript jsdoc comment specification.

Summary, Syntax, Description, Examples

--
. ClassName < SuperClass [Type] {Parent}
--
This tells jsdoc that the description of ClassName is being initialized that
it inherits all the methods and properties in the prototype of SuperClass and
that it's located in the Parent object (as in it's a property of that object,
used for namespaces)

Type can be Namespace, Normal or Abstract. A Namespace can't be constructed thus
the .@ and .# are equal to @ and #.

--
>> ClassName/Object/Other
--
Add stuff to that object/class.

--
@ Name [Type]
--
Start the property description.

--
# Name (param1 [, param2[, ... paramn]]) => Type
  - param1 [Type]: Description
  ...
--
Add a method with param1 as required and param2 to paramn as optional.
The returned variable is of type Type.
And the - parameter name starts the description of the passed parameters.

--
.@
.#
--
Are the same as @ and # but for static stuff.
